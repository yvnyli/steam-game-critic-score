Thank you for evaluating my project. 
I made this guide only to help you navigate the repo and files.
Please feel free to grade my project as you see fit.

## Evaluation Criteria

* Problem description
    * See `README.md`.
* EDA
    * See `1_EDA.ipynb`.
* Model training
    * See `2_training.ipynb`.
* Exporting notebook to script
    * See `2_training_final.py`.
* Reproducibility
    * Since the dataset is very large, I committed a smaller subset of it.
    * `1_EDA.ipynb` can be run.
    * `2_training.ipynb` takes about XX minutes to run. I recommend running `2_training_sub.ipynb` which only takes XX minutes.
    * `2_training_final.py` can be run.
* Model deployment
    * The model is deployed to the cloud. You can test it [here]().
* Dependency and enviroment management
    * See `README.md` for instructions to activate the environment.
* Containerization
    * See `README.md` for instructions to build and run the container.
* Cloud deployment
    * The model is deployed to the cloud. You can test it [here]().
